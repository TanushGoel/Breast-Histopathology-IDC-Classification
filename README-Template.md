# Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN

A convolutional neural network that classifies between 133 dog breeds given picture input. The algorithm detects if there is a dog or a human in the image and will predict the breed of the dog or what dog breed the human resembles.

This is a project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program, as a part of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) section in the Advanced Machine Learning semester (semester 2).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
