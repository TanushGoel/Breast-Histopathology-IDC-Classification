# Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN

A convolutional neural network that classifies between 133 dog breeds given picture input. The algorithm detects if there is a dog or a human in the image and will predict the breed of the dog or what dog breed the human resembles.


This is a project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program, as a part of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) section in the Advanced Machine Learning semester (semester 2).
